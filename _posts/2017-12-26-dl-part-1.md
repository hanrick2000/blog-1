This is the first in a several-part series on the basics of deep learning, presented in an easy-to-read, lightweight format. Previous experience with basic probability and matrix algebra will be helpful, but not required. Send any comments or corrections to [josh@jzhanson.com](mailto:josh@jzhanson.com).

## Bayes' Rule

We begin our discussion with Bayes' rule, an important result that captures the intuitive relationship between an event and prior knowledge we have of factors that might affect the probability of the event. Simply put, it formulates how event B affects the probability of event A. It forms the basis of Bayesian inference and Naive Bayes.
